Informational inaccuracy (Poor data quality)
This could lead to lost revenue, poor customer experience and in long term even to the reputational
damage.
The way to mitigate it is to hire staff that will oversee editing content and making sure it is up to date.
Although for the scope of this project I will not be implementing CMS (Content Management System), it
might be a sensible solution for farther development, as it will reduce the complexity of maintaining the
website, therefore increase efficiency. The reason being is that it allows for content change in a nice user-
friendly interface, which essentially does not require programming knowledge, therefore could be done
by content creators.
